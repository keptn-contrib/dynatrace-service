## Installation 


### 1. Gather Dynatrace and Keptn Credentials

To function correctly, the *dynatrace-service* requires access to a Dynatrace Tenant and to the Keptn API.

*  The credentials for the Dynatrace Tenant include `DT_API_TOKEN` and `DT_TENANT`: 

    * To create a Dynatrace API Token `DT_API_TOKEN`, log in to your Dynatrace tenant and go to **Settings > Integration > Dynatrace API**. Then, create a new API token with the following permissions:
      - Access problem and event feed, metrics, and topology
      - Read log content
      - Read configuration
      - Write configuration
      - Capture request data

    * The `DT_TENANT` has to be set according to the appropriate pattern:
      - Dynatrace SaaS tenant: `{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com`
      - Dynatrace-managed tenant: `{your-domain}/e/{your-environment-id}` 

* The credentials for access to Keptn include `KEPTN_API_URL`, `KEPTN_API_TOKEN` and optionally `KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL`:

    * To determine the values for `KEPTN_API_URL` and `KEPTN_API_TOKEN` please refer to the [Keptn docs](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.8.x/operate/install/). 
   
    * If you would like to make use of the inclusion of backlinks to the Keptn Bridge, you `KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL` should also be provided. To find the URL of the bridge, please refer to the following section of the [Keptn docs](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.8.x/reference/bridge/#expose-lockdown-bridge). 

While setting up the service, it is recommended to gather these and set them as environment variables:

```console
DT_API_TOKEN=<DT_API_TOKEN>
DT_TENANT=<DT_TENANT>
KEPTN_API_URL=<KEPTN_API_URL>
KEPTN_API_TOKEN=<KEPTN_API_TOKEN>
KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL=<KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL> # optional
```

### 2. Create a Secret with Credentials

Create a secret (named `dynatrace` by default) containing the credentials for the Dynatrace Tenant (`DT_API_TOKEN` and `DT_TENANT`) and optionally for the Keptn API (`KEPTN_API_URL`, `KEPTN_API_TOKEN` and `KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL`). This secret should be stored in the same namespace as where the service is installed.

```console
kubectl -n keptn create secret generic dynatrace \
--from-literal="DT_API_TOKEN=$DT_API_TOKEN" \
--from-literal="DT_TENANT=$DT_TENANT" \
--from-literal="KEPTN_API_URL=$KEPTN_API_URL" \
--from-literal="KEPTN_API_TOKEN=$KEPTN_API_TOKEN" \
--from-literal="KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL=$KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL" \
-oyaml --dry-run=client | kubectl replace -f -
```

 If the Keptn credentials are omitted from this main secret, `KEPTN_API_TOKEN` must be provided by the `keptn-api-token` secret. Furthermore, `dynatraceService.config.keptnApiUrl` and optionally `dynatraceService.config.keptnBridgeUrl` must be set when applying the helm chart (see below).

### 3. Deploy the Service

To deploy the current version of the *dynatrace-service* in your Kubernetes cluster, use the helm chart located in the `chart` directory.
Please use the same namespace for the *dynatrace-service* as you are using for Keptn, e.g. `keptn`.

```console
helm upgrade --install dynatrace-service -n keptn https://github.com/keptn-contrib/dynatrace-service/releases/download/$VERSION/dynatrace-service-$VERSION.tgz
```

The installation can then be verified using:

```console
kubectl -n keptn get deployment dynatrace-service -o wide
kubectl -n keptn get pods -l run=dynatrace-service
```

**Notes**: 
* Replace `$VERSION` with the desired version number (e.g. 0.15.1) you want to install.
* Variables may be set by appending key-value pairs with the syntax `--set key=value`
* If the `KEPTN_API_URL` and optionally `KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL` were not provided via a secret (see above) they should be provided using the variables `dynatraceService.config.keptnApiUrl` and `dynatraceService.config.keptnBridgeUrl`, i.e. by appending `--set dynatraceService.config.keptnApiUrl=$KEPTN_API_URL --set dynatraceService.config.keptnBridgeUrl=$KEPTN_BRIDGE_URL`.
* The `dynatrace-service` can automatically generate tagging rules, problem notifications, management zones, dashboards, and custom metric events in your Dynatrace tenant. You can configure whether these entities should be generated within your Dynatrace tenant by the environment variables specified in the provided `chart/values.yaml`, i.e. using the variables `dynatraceService.config.generateTaggingRules` (default `false`), `dynatraceService.config.generateProblemNotifications` (default `false`), `dynatraceService.config.generateManagementZones` (default `false`), `dynatraceService.config.generateDashboards` (default `false`), `dynatraceService.config.generateMetricEvents` (default `false`), and `dynatraceService.config.synchronizeDynatraceServices` (default `true`).
 
* The `dynatrace-service` by default validates the SSL certificate of the Dynatrace API. If your Dynatrace API only has a self-signed certificate, you can disable the SSL certificate check by setting the environment variable `dynatraceService.config.httpSSLVerify` (default `true`) specified in the [values.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-contrib/dynatrace-service/$VERSION/chart/values.yaml) to `false`.

* The `dynatrace-service` can be configured to use a proxy server via the `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` environment variables  as described in [`httpproxy.FromEnvironment()`](https://golang.org/pkg/vendor/golang.org/x/net/http/httpproxy/#FromEnvironment). As the `dynatrace-service` connects to a `distributor`, a `NO_PROXY` entry including `127.0.0.1` should be used to prevent these from being proxied. The `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables can be configured using the `dynatraceService.config.httpProxy` (default `""`) and `dynatraceService.config.httpsProxy` (default `""`) in [values.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-contrib/dynatrace-service/$VERSION/chart/values.yaml), `NO_PROXY` is set to `127.0.0.1` by default. For example:

  ```console
  helm upgrade --install dynatrace-service -n keptn https://github.com/keptn-contrib/dynatrace-service/releases/download/$VERSION/dynatrace-service.tgz --set dynatraceService.config.httpProxy=http://mylocalproxy:1234 --set dynatraceService.config.httpsProxy=https://mylocalproxy:1234
  ```

* When an event is sent out by Keptn, you see an event in Dynatrace for the correlating service:

  ![Dynatrace events](images/events.png?raw=true "Dynatrace Events")

### 4. (Optional) Set up Dynatrace monitoring for existing Keptn projects

If you already have created a project using Keptn and would like to enable Dynatrace monitoring for that project afterwards, please execute the following command:

```console
keptn configure monitoring dynatrace --project=<PROJECT_NAME>
```

**ATTENTION:** If you have different Dynatrace Tenants (or Managed Environments) and want to make sure a Keptn project is linked to the correct Dynatrace Tenant/Environment please have a look at the `dynatrace.conf.yaml` file option as explained below. It allows you to specify which Dynatrace Tenant/Environment to use on a project level. This requires that you first upload `dynatrace.conf.yaml` on project level before executing `keptn configure monitoring`.

## Additional Installation Options

### Configuration of project- & Keptn-wide Dynatrace credentials

The service you the option to configure project-wide-default or keptn-wide-default credentials. For project-wide, the secret needs to be named  `dynatrace-credentials-YOURPROJECT`. For keptn-wide the secret can either be called `dynatrace-credentials` or just `dynatrace`.

The following is an example to define a secret for a Keptn project called sockshop:

```console
kubectl create secret generic dynatrace-credentials-sockshop -n "keptn" --from-literal="DT_TENANT=$DT_TENANT" --from-literal="DT_API_TOKEN=$DT_API_TOKEN"
```

And here is an example to specify a Keptn-wide default secret that is used in case there is no project-wide secret defined for a particular Keptn project

```console
kubectl create secret generic dynatrace -n "keptn" --from-literal="DT_TENANT=$DT_TENANT" --from-literal="DT_API_TOKEN=$DT_API_TOKEN"
```

### Configurations of Credentials through `dynatrace.conf.yaml`

More fine grained control over Dynatrace Credential Management as well as configuring the behavior of other features of the *dynatrace-service* on a project, service and stage level is provided through `dynatrace.conf.yaml` files. 

When the *dynatrace-service* is processing a *sh.keptn.internal.event.get-sli* event it looks for the file called `dynatrace/dynatrace.conf.yaml` in the Keptn Configuration Repository. It first looks for it on the service, then the stage and then finally the project level. This configuration file allows you to configure the following behavior:
* Which k8s secret to use to pull Dynatrace Tenant Credentials (`DT_TENANT` & `DT_API_TOKEN`)
* Whether to pull SLI/SLO information from a Dynatrace dashboard or use the stored `sli.yaml` and `slo.yaml` in the Keptn Configuration Repository

Here is an example `dynatrace.conf.yaml`:

```yaml
spec_version: '0.1.0'
dtCreds: dynatrace-preprod
dashboard: query
```

To upload this to your Keptn project you can for instance use the Keptn CLI:

```console
keptn add-resource --project=yourproject --stage=yourstage --resource=./dynatrace.conf.yaml --resourceUri=dynatrace/dynatrace.conf.yaml
```

**`dtCreds`**

`dtCreds` allows you to specify the name of the k8s secret in your Keptn namespace that holds the required credentials to connect to the Dynatrace Tenant. This extends the default behavior as explained in the beginning by having the *dynatrace-service* first look at the secret defined in dtCreds. If `dtCreds` is not specified or if there is no `dynatrace.conf.yaml` at all then it just does the default behavior.

In the example above where `dtCreds` was specified with the value *dynatrace-preprod* the *dynatrace-service* would be looking for the first matching secret in the following order: *dynatrace-preprod*, *dynatrace-credentials-YOUR-KEPTN-PROJECT*, *dynatrace-credentials*, *dynatrace*
If none of these secrets is configured in your k8s Keptn namespace the *dynatrace-service* will respond with an error indicating that no Dynatrace credentials could be found!

For completeness, here is an example of how to create a secret that matches the `dynatrace.conf.yaml`:

```console
kubectl create secret generic dynatrace-preprod -n "keptn" --from-literal="DT_TENANT=$DT_TENANT" --from-literal="DT_API_TOKEN=$DT_API_TOKEN"
```

`dtCreds` was requested by many users as it gives you the option to specify credentials for your different Dynatrace Tenants, e.g. my-dynatrace-preprod, my-dynatrace-prod, my-dynatrace-dev. And then you can configure on project, stage or even service level which Dynatrace Tenant to be used. This gives you all flexiblity to manage multiple environments within a single project but separate it out by e.g. stages.

## Up- or Downgrading

Adapt and use the following command in case you want to up- or downgrade your installed version (specified by the `$VERSION` placeholder):

```console
helm upgrade dynatrace-service -n keptn https://github.com/keptn-contrib/dynatrace-service/releases/download/$VERSION/dynatrace-service-$VERSION.tgz
```

## Uninstall

To delete a deployed *dynatrace-service*, use the Helm CLI to uninstall the installed release of the service:

```console
helm delete -n keptn dynatrace-service
```
