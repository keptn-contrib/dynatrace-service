# Evaluation fails


## Could not retrieve any SLI results

Evaluation fails but the shipyard-controller reports:
> `could not retrieve any SLI results`

![Could not retrieve any SLI results](images/could-not-retrieve-any-sli-results.png)

Likely cause:
- SLIs and SLOs should be defined using YAML files but no SLOs have been defined i.e. no `slo.yaml` file can be found

Suggested solution:


## No evaluation performed by Lighthouse because SLI failed

Evaluation fails and the shipyard-controller reports:
> `no evaluation performed by lighthouse because SLI failed....`

![No evaluation performed by Lighthouse](images/no-evaluation-performed-by-lighthouse.png)

In this case the Lighthouse performed no evaluation because the received `sh.keptn.event.get-sli.finished` event had a `result` of `fail`. The root cause can be identified from the `message` field of this event.

In instances where this is related to a specific SLI, check the `message` field of the individual SLI result in the within `indicatorValues`. This can be viewed in Keptn UI by expanding the `sh.keptn.event.get-sli.finished` event and viewing its payload:

The following subsections detail some common messages as well as likely causes and solutions:

### Message: `Could not retrieve any SLI results` 

**Likely cause**

- SLIs and SLOs should be defined using YAML files but no SLOs have been defined, i.e. no `slo.yaml` file can be found

**Suggested solution**

- If SLIs and SLOs should be defined using YAML files, define SLOs by creating a `slo.yaml` file, or
- If SLIs and SLOs should be sourced from a dashboard, add a [`dashboard` entry to the `dynatrace/dynatrace.conf.yaml` configuration file](dynatrace-conf-yaml-file.md#dashboard-sli-mode-configuration-dashboard)

### Message: `Metrics API v2 returned zero data points`

**Likely cause**

- No data is available for an SLI during the evaluation timeframe

**Suggested solution**

- Check the availability of data for the associated SLIs during the evaluation timeframe, e.g. using the Data Explorer in the Dynatrace tenant

### Message: `Metrics API v2 returned more than one data point`

**Likely cause**

- Multiple data points are returned for an SLI during the evaluation timeframe where only one is expected

**Suggested solution**

- Ensure the SLI only returns a single data point by e.g. including a `merge` or `splitBy` transformation in the query

### Message: `could not query Dynatrace dashboard for SLIs: error while processing dashboard config '12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abcd' - Dynatrace API error (404): Dashboard 12345678-1234-1234-1234-12345678abcd not found`

**Likely cause**

- Dynatrace-service is configured to query a specific dashboard for SLIs (i.e. [`dynatrace/dynatrace.conf.yaml` contains `dashboard: <dashboard-id>`](dynatrace-conf-yaml-file.md#dashboard-sli-mode-configuration-dashboard)) but no dashboard with the specified ID is available

**Suggested solution**

 - If SLIs and SLOs should be sourced from a dashboard, ensure `dynatrace/dynatrace.conf.yaml` contains a `dashboard: <dashboard-id>` entry with the correct dashboard ID, or
 - If SLIs and SLOs should be defined using YAML files, remove the `dashboard: <dashboard-id>` entry from `dynatrace/dynatrace.conf.yaml`

### Message: `could not query Dynatrace dashboard for SLIs: error while processing dashboard config '' - could not find a matching dashboard name - e.g. KQG;project=<project>;service=<service>;stage=<stage>`

**Likely cause**

- Dynatrace-service is configured to query a dashboard for SLIs (i.e. `dynatrace/dynatrace.conf.yaml` contains `dashboard: query`) but no dashboard named with the pattern `KQG;project=<project>;service=<service>;stage=<stage>` is available

**Suggested solution**

- If SLIs and SLOs should be sourced from a dashboard, create a dashboard named with the pattern `KQG;project=<project>;service=<service>;stage=<stage>` in the Dynatrace tenant, or
- If SLIs and SLOs should be defined using YAML files, remove the [`dashboard: query` entry from `dynatrace/dynatrace.conf.yaml`](dynatrace-conf-yaml-file.md#dashboard-sli-mode-configuration-dashboard)
