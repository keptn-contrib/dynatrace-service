## Release validated with

||||
|---|---|---|
| Dynatrace-service: `0.22.0` | Keptn: `0.12.6` * | Dynatrace: `1.235` |

&ast; **Note**: to install dynatrace-service 0.22.0 for Keptn 0.14.1 or later, please override the bundled distributor version and target the appropriate Keptn version by setting the Helm chart variable `distributor.image.tag`, i.e. by appending `--set distributor.image.tag=...` during the Helm upgrade.

## Overview

The dynatrace-service allows you to integrate Dynatrace monitoring in your Keptn sequences. It provides the following capabilities:

- [**SLI-provider**](documentation/sli-provider.md): To support the evaluation of the quality gates, the dynatrace-service can be configured to retrieve SLIs for a Keptn project, stage or service. 

- [**Forwarding events from Keptn to Dynatrace**](documentation/event-forwarding-to-dynatrace.md): The dynatrace-service can forward events such as remediation, deployment, test start/stop, evaluation or release events to Dynatrace using attach rules to ensure that the correct monitored entities are associated with the event.

- [**Forwarding problem notifications from Dynatrace to Keptn**](documentation/problem-forwarding-to-keptn.md): The dynatrace-service can support triggering remediation sequences by forwarding problem notifications from Dynatrace to a Keptn environment and ensuring that the `sh.keptn.events.problem` event is mapped to the correct project, service and stage.

- [**Automatic onboarding of monitored service entities**](documentation/auto-service-onboarding.md): The dynatrace-service can be configured to periodically check for new service entities detected by Dynatrace and automatically import these into Keptn.

### Upgrading to 0.18.0 or newer
