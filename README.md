The *dynatrace-service* is a [Keptn-service](https://keptn.sh) that forwards Keptn events - occurring during a delivery workflow - to Dynatrace. In addition, the service is responsible for configuring your Dynatrace tenant to fully interact with the Keptn installation.
 
The service is subscribed to the following [Keptn CloudEvents](https://github.com/keptn/spec/blob/master/cloudevents.md):

- sh.keptn.events.deployment-finished
- sh.keptn.events.evaluation-done
- sh.keptn.events.tests-finished
- sh.keptn.internal.event.project.create
- sh.keptn.event.monitoring.configure
- sh.keptn.event.get-sli.triggered

The *dynatrace-service* is a [Keptn](https://keptn.sh) service that is responsible for retrieving the values of SLIs from your Dynatrace Tenant via the Dynatrace Metrics v2 API endpoint. For that it handles the Keptn Event *sh.keptn.internal.event.get-sli* which gets sent as part of a quality gate evaluation!

The *dynatrace-service* provides the capabilty to connect to different Dynatrace Tenants for your Keptn projects, stages or services. It also allows you to either define SLIs through `sli.yaml` files or through a Dynatrace dashboard and all of this is configurable through `dynatrace.conf.yaml`:

By default, even if you do not specify a custom `sli.yaml` or a Dynatrace dashboard, the following SLIs are automatically supported in case you reference them in your `slo.yaml`:

```yaml
 - throughput: builtin:service.requestCount.total
 - error_rate: builtin:service.errors.total.rate
 - response_time_p50: builtin:service.response.time:percentile(50)
 - response_time_p90: builtin:service.response.time:percentile(90)
 - response_time_p95: builtin:service.response.time:percentile(95)
```

By default these metrics (SLIs) are queried from a Dynatrace-monitored service entity with the tags `keptn_project`, `keptn_service`, `keptn_stage` & `keptn_deployment`.

As highlighted above, the *dynatrace-service* also provides the following capabilities:

* Connecting to different Dynatrace Tenants (SaaS or Managed) depending on Keptn Project, Stage or Service

* Defining a custom list of SLIs based on the Dynatrace Metrics API v2. This allows SLIs to reference any metric in Dynatrace: Application, Service, Process Groups, Host, Custom Devices, Calculated Service Metrics, External Metrics ...

* Visually defining SLIs & SLOs through a Dynatrace Dashboard instead of `sli.yaml` and `slo.yaml`
